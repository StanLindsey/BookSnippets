    bio: "<p>Elizabeth Housden is a professional British actress, who started writing firstly plays for her theatre company and then branching out to write novels for children and later for adults as well. Her play written for television&iacute;s Big Arts Week, The Jade King and the Animals of Destiny, for which she won an award - the only piece of drama in the Big Arts Week programme to be chosen from 1,400 entries as the only one televised - has been highly acclaimed and performed all over the world. She has now adapted the play as a novel for children under the same title. It is the re-telling of the myth behind the formation of the Chinese Zodiac and is published by Shimran.  She is currently writing novels for adults and her first historical novel, The Gentlemen Go By, set in the late 18th century on the Isle of Wight where she grew up, has recently been accepted alongside The Jade King, for presentation at the Dubai International Writers Centre. She has long maintained that her professional training as an actress has been invaluable in helping create believeable characters and that is the subject of her talk.  As well as running her own theatre company for the past 14 years she taught drama at Bedales School and she continues to be a mentor to many of her former pupils who have gone on to be professional actors. She lectures on theatre and its superstitions and is positively evangelical in getting young people to understand and fall in love with Shakespeare. She and her husband live in Hampshire and in London and together they have four children, two sons and two daughters, and six grandchildren. </p>"

    description: "<p>The year is 1788, the year before the French Revolution. In Paris the mood against the king and the aristocrats is becoming increasingly ugly. Across the Channel, in London, the nineteen year old orphan, socialite Lady Sophia Catesby, is left alone when her step-father, Edward, Earl of Roxford, is killed fighting for his country in a foreign war. Yet she is not to be too much pitied as he has left her a fortune. But also there is a stipulation...   Until she inherits the money at the age of twenty-one, she is to leave London and reside with a guardian. That guardian is his best friend and first cousin, Jacques, Marquis de St Aubin, a man she has barely heard of and never met. Despairing, angry and frustrated, Sophia knows she must obey. She knows she will despise him and find this unknown bachelor, a contemporary of Edward's, dull and tedious. But who really is Jacques?   Sophia has much to learn of Jacques and also about the reasons behind this en-forced exile. But unbeknownst to her danger is lurking in the shape of her loathed uncle William, a spendthrift, a snob and a bully and now the new Earl of Roxford. And Edward has placed another proviso, one perhaps he shouldn't have for it has made William a very dangerous man indeed. But to begin with neither she, nor Jacques have yet realised it...</p>",

Tom is catapulted into a chaotic world where bureaucracy and process have taken over from all reason. Good management techniques, intellectual capital and profit have been totally ignored in order to perpetuate an organisational structure. Nobody knows what the company actually does, and Tom, now in charge, is given the biggest challenge to find out. Add into this multiple attempts on his life, his quest to find true love, an investigation into a murder without a victim, the first rule of being a private investigator, and the impending total collapse of four universes, and we have a tangled knot that even Alexander the Great would have trouble cutting through. Tom has to do something, otherwise it will be the end of everything he knows, and quite a few bits he doesn't know about. This is not beep-beep science fiction but a sarcastic lusty romp through everything wrong with business and life today, neatly wrapped up in a bit of sci-fi and interconnected adventures.
